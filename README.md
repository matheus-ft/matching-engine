# Matching Engine

This project is an exercise to build a simple matching engine that deals one security and receives order by quoting at the terminal.

---

## Sendind Orders and Seeing Trades

The engine expects inputs in the following format:

```shell
limit <side> <price> <qty>
```

or

```shell
market <side> <qty>
```

(Market orders don't have a specified price, so they trade at the best offer available)

And, for simplicity, it is considered that the input is always in the correct format. As if the engine received the order from a button pressed and not an actual string typed by a person who could make a mistake - yes, this is a point where the project could improve, with a good quoting syntax (and NLP, maybe).

The outputs, however, are only two:

> Trade, price: \<price>, qty: \<qty>

if a match was found, and

> Booking failed: no orders to match

if a market order could not trade (limit orders that don't trade will always be booked/"stored").

## The matching algorithm

### Data structures

The `OrderBook` is a class that has two binary search trees, each representing one side of the book (`BookSide`). The nodes of the binary search trees are called Price `Level`s, which are, in fact, queues (implemented using a doubly linked list) of `Order`s (which, in turn, are generated by the `Quote`s received).

---

### Performance

The binary search tree data structure was chosen so that the **average** time complexity for the search of **any** price level would be *O(log(n))* - which includes findind the levels for the **best bid** (the **highest buy** price) and the **best ask** (the **lowest sell** price) for any market order.
The queue, in turn, was chosen to guarantee that the orders would be matched following **FIFO** and, also, that insertion and remotion in them would be *O(1)*.

---

### Exception to the FIFO policy

The algorithm will only match limit orders that represent "good offers" to each other. That is, if a limit order to buy *n* shares at price *x* arrives, "good offer" is an order to sell *m* shares at price *y* with *x >= y*. The opposite is also true: arriving a sell *n* shares at price *x*, then a good offer is a buy *m* shares at price *y* with *x <= y* (the conditions over *m* and *n* will appear).

It should be noted, however, that the cases in which *x == y*, the order can be matched in place, which means that their prices will stay the same, only the quantities will change.

If that is not the case, however, the amount of shares and the total volume (quantity times price) of the offers can make the trade impossible. In fact, it is only possible to trade if both of them are different (*m != n* and *ym != xn*), so that the one with less volume can be updated to a better price and lower quantity (with both equal, there's no room for change).

To make this simulated market more liquid, the algorithm will not stop at the head of the queue if the volume and quantity conditions are not met. This is not an exception to the FIFO policy *per se*, it is more of a secondary step to match orders, in which total volume has an advantage.

Important considerations:

* The order to be changed (the one with higher volume) can be the already booked one. In this case, since its price will change, this order must be reallocated to a proper level. To respect the FIFO in the new price level, the order is inserted considering its timestamp relative to the other ones already in queue. Unfortunately, this insertion is *O(m)* (with *m* being the numbers of orders in the doubly-linked list).

* The condition over the prices for an offer to be good is so that the order changed (whether it is a buy or sell) will always be closer to the best offer, which will **increase the chance of a match**.
  * if the order changed is a buy, its price will increase, making it closer to being the best bid
  * if the order changes is a sell, its price will decrease, making it closer to being the best ask

## Why Python?

Since this exercise was done in about a week, I prioritized development speed over execution speed. As I am more familiar with Python than Java and C++, I was able to code faster. But it should not be difficult to translate the program to another language, specially considering that no outside package was used and that it was already *kinda* done from C (see [data-structures](https://github.com/matheus-ft/data-structures) repo).
